_Edgegaming home assignment - React app_

Few things to note:

1.  Some of it contains cheap and dirty code, because of the time limits
    (of my schedule). In an ideal world, all the elements would have
    there styled version and the site will be more responsive.
2.  Another thing that I'll do if I'll have more time is "to interface"
    the tasks, So the input can implement directly the "Task"
    "interface" (with the help of prototypal inheritance or ts) and not
    just indirectly (with the help of the `obj[propName]` JS syntax)
3.  Unit tests is probably could be useful here.
4.  Please do not use this program commercially or in any other way
    without my consent.

To run:

    npm i
    npm start
